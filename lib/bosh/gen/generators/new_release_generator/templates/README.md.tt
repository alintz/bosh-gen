# BOSH release for <%= project_name %>

This BOSH release and deployment manifest deploy a cluster of <%= project_name %>.

## Usage

This repository includes base manifests and operator files. They can be used for initial deployments and subsequently used for updating your deployments:

```plain
export BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=<bosh-alias>
export BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=<%= project_name %>
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/<%= project_name %>-boshrelease.git
bosh deploy <%= project_name %>-boshrelease/manifests/<%= project_name %>.yml
```

If your BOSH does not have Credhub/Config Server, then remember `--vars-store` to allow generation of passwords and certificates.

### Update

When new versions of `<%= project_name %>-boshrelease` are released the `manifests/<%= project_name %>.yml` file will be updated. This means you can easily `git pull` and `bosh deploy` to upgrade.

```plain
export BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=<bosh-alias>
export BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=<%= project_name %>
cd <%= project_name %>-boshrelease
git pull
cd -
bosh deploy <%= project_name %>-boshrelease/manifests/<%= project_name %>.yml
```
